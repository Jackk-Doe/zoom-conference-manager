# üß± Tech Stack

The technology stack we decided to use is a mix of technologies that are popular in the industry, and that we are comfortable with or interested in. This section documents the main technology elements of our application.

## Frontend

### React ‚öõÔ∏è

Our client application is built in React, the most popular Javascript framework. We chose React because of it's popularity, and because some of our team have previous experience with it. React's popularity means that it has a healthy community and a large ecosystem around it to help us with development.

### Typescript

Our application is written in Typescript rather than Javascript. Typescript is a superset of Javascript, meant to improve on the weak points of the language. Typescript provides many benefits over Javascript, the main one being that it provides static typing to Javascript. This helps us to structure our app better, and to catch bugs before code is even run.

### React Router v6

React router provides the client application with client-side routing to control the structure of the web app. It will also provide layout nesting with it's outlet functionality, allowing us to dynamically load parts of the page.

### Axios

Axios is our chosen HTTP library. It will provide the functionality required to set default headers for requests, manage request authorization, and make requests to our REST API.

### React Query

React Query is our solution for managing server state on the client. It includes built-in functionality for query caching, stale data revalidation, and loading/error states.

### React Hook Form

React hook form is a very popular and robust library for managing form state in React. It uses React hooks to provide components with the necessary functions and data to manage a form. It takes care of managing input values, form submission, and form validation and error handling.
